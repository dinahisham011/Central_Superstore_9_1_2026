# Central_Superstore_Dashboard_9_1_2026
This project presents an interactive Sales Performance Dashboard built using Power BI.
The dashboard provides insights into sales, profit, customer behavior, product performance, shipping methods, and geographic distribution to support data-driven business decisions.

The dataset represents transactional sales data across multiple product categories, customer segments, shipping modes, and U.S. locations.
# Business Objectives
The dashboard was designed to answer key business questions, including:
-How are sales and profit performing over time?
-Which product categories and sub-categories are profitable or loss-making?
-Which customers and products contribute most to revenue?
-How do shipping modes impact sales distribution?
-What is the sales contribution by customer segment and geography?
